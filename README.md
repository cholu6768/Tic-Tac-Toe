# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
**The game works like this:**
1. The AI always starts its move on the center of the board witht an "X". 
2. The user chooses its move every turn by selecting a number from the board and after a "O" will be put on the board.
3. The board from the user and the board of the AI is shown after both choose their moves. 
4. Every turn the program checks if somebody won and if no one wins after 9 turns the game ends with a tie.

NOTE: This game was tested on a windows console. The Replit Python environment changed the appereance of the board, some lines from the board were shaped to the left but that still should not ruin the game experience :)
